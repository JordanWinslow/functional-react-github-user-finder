### Detailed Description:
<p>
This project utilizes functional OOP & ditches class-based React.js components in favor of React Hooks, Context Management & higher order functions to dynamically render user profile information from the GitHub API onto a fully responsive CSS grid that is styled with styled-components and animated with CSS keyframes and modern transitional animations.
</p>
<p>  
In this repository I leverage the full power of JavaScript's multi-paradigm capabilities along with modern react hooks and context management to demonstrate how much cleaner, more readable and maintainable the code can get by adopting a modern approach to inheritance and combining the good features of classical OOP with FP!

To see what this same program looks like with class based React components and how much more bloated and hard to maintain the code becomes, take a look at this repo: <strong><a href="https://github.com/JordanWinslow/classical-react-github-user-finder">https://github.com/JordanWinslow/classical-react-github-user-finder</a></strong>
